**Project Name: DataSpark – Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics
Introduction:**

Global Electronics, a leading retailer of consumer electronics, is striving to leverage its vast data to enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive overall business growth. This project, titled "DataSpark: Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics," aims to conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on their data to uncover valuable insights and actionable recommendations.

**Problem Statement:**

As part of Global Electronics' data analytics team, you are tasked with conducting a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover valuable insights from the company’s data. Your goal is to provide actionable recommendations that can enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive overall business growth.
Global Electronics, a leading retailer of consumer electronics, has provided you with several datasets containing information about their customers, products, sales, stores, and currency exchange rates.
The company seeks to leverage this data to better understand their business and identify areas for improvement.

**Packages Used:**

•	**Pandas:**

Pandas is a powerful and open-source Python library. The Pandas library is used for data manipulation and analysis. Pandas consist of data structures and functions to perform efficient operations on data.

•	**MySQL:**

MySQL is a widely-used open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of data. It operates on a relational model, meaning that data is organized into tables consisting of rows and columns, enabling easy relationships between different data points. MySQL supports SQL (Structured Query Language), which is the standard language for interacting with databases, making it a powerful tool for creating, modifying, and querying databases.

**Install Packages:**

•	**Pandas** – pip install pandas

•	**MySQL Connector**– pip install mysql-connector-python
 
**Software Used:**

**•	Visual Studio Code:**

Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, macOS and web browsers. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded version control with Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add functionality.
Performed EDA in visual studio code.

**•	MySQL Workbench:**

MySQL Workbench is a visual tool that helps database architects, developers, and DBAs work with MySQL servers and databases. It's a cross-platform, open-source tool that combines SQL development, database design, and administration into a single environment. Stores the data and have written queries for insight

**•	Power Bi:**

Power BI, or Power Business Intelligence, is a Microsoft platform that helps users analyse, visualize, and share data for business intelligence (BI) purposes. It's a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that can turn data from different sources into interactive insights. Power BI can connect to data from Excel spreadsheets, cloud-based data warehouses, and on-premises hybrid data warehouses. It can then help users build charts, graphs, and dashboards to visualize the data.
